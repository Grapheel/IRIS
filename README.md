#Issue tracker for Grapheel IRIS's beta
##What's IRIS? What is a beta? How to provide feedback?

Summer of 2017 Grapheel launched the first beta of [IRIS](www.grapheel.com/home/iris/), our web app designed to help expert volunteers describe STEM images for blind and visually impaired students. We are excited to ask you to test a new version of IRIS, redesigned from the ground up to be a better user experience.

###Beta version

A beta version means things don't always go as expected. Some features might not work as we expect, some other don't function the way you expected them to do so, and some are just simply missing. That's the pinch of salt, but the good thing is that a beta is the chance for you to help us shape the service to match your expectations.

###Feedback system

We are using a service called GitHub as our interactive, accessible ticketing system where you can raise all the issues you find with IRIS.

How does the workflow look like?:

1. You need a GitHub account. If you have one, log in, if you don't, [create an account](https://github.com/login). It's free, and all you need is an e-mail address.
2. Once logged in, make sure you are on: https://github.com/Grapheel/IRIS-issues
3. click 'issues'.
4. click 'new issue' or 'create an issue'.
5. Enter a title for your bug report or feature request.
6. Fill out the template we provided, by answering as many questions as you can.
7. click 'submit new issue'.

##What happens after I submitted a new issue?

Our developer team will investigate the issue, and if necessary open up a discussion to learn more about the bug, feature request, or just to say it's fixed.

##What do I need to let you know?

As much as you can, so we can replicate the issue if it's a problem with an existing feature, or a clear description if you'd like IRIS to do certain things slightly, or very differently.

Go through the following checklist before submitting an issue:

- [ ] Have you told us whether you are a sighted volunteer or visually impaired user?
- [ ] Have you told us the type of device you are using? Let's say iPhone 6 or Windows PC.
- [ ] Have you told us your operating system? FOr instance are you using Windows 10 64bit, or an Android OS?
- [ ] Have you told us what web browser are you using? For example Chrome or Safari?
- [ ] Have you told us the nature of the issue e.g. bug or new feature request?
- [ ] Have you described the matter of the issue?
